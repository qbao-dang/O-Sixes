        <h2>Escape solo queue</h2>
        <p>Let's face it: solo queue can be rough times. Every match is essentially a pick-up game and you never know who you will get on your team.  Your SR is your own, and no one else's.  This creates a system where individual play can overshadow team play. O-Sixes solves this problem by putting you on a team that you will play with week-after-week.</p>

        <h2>Learn to play as a team</h2>
        <p>If you want to get better at kicking a soccer ball, you can practice in your back yard.  If you want to get better at playing soccer, you need to join a soccer team. The same idea applies to Overwatch.  The best way for you to become better is to play on a regular team.</p>

        <h2>Win as a team</h2>
        <p>When you have the opportunity to repeatedly play with a set team in a set league, you will learn the strengths and weakness of your teammates. This allows you and your team to grow together and develop strategies that work.</p>

        <h2>Be part of a community</h2>
        <p>Leagues create the environment for teams to compete in.  Your team will be set in a division within a league that plays at a set time every week. Remember your loss to Team B two weeks ago? Now you have a chance to play them again next week and pull your team into third place.</p>
